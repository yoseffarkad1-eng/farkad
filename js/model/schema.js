//
// v2 is keyed by date and worker id:

//   days["2026-08-12"].plan["w_01"]   = { entries: [{ placeId }] }
//   days["2026-08-12"].actual["w_01"] = { entries: [{ placeId, rate, extraHours }] }

//
// plan   = the seder written the night before, by whoever is doing it
// actual = what really happened, recorded after work; this is what pay and invoices
//          are calculated from
//
// Because every value hangs off a (date, worker) path, two people editing different
