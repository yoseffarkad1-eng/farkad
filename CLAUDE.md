# פרקד — the working brief

Read this before changing anything. Every comment in this codebase names the failure
the code below it prevents; this file is the same habit at repository scale. The deeper
walk is in `docs/architecture.md`; the test suites are described in `tests/README.md`;
what has actually been served, and what each build is known NOT to cover, is in
`docs/releases.md`.

## What this is

A Hebrew, RTL, offline-first PWA that records who worked at which construction site,
and produces the pay sheet and the client invoice from that record. Three people share
one record across three phones, on building sites with unreliable signal, and the
phones do not update together. It is not a shift planner — the seder goes out on
WhatsApp; the app records what HAPPENED. Every number in it is somebody's pay, so the
failure that matters is never a crash: it is a record that quietly says something
different from what was done.

## The architecture, one screen

- **Classic scripts, one global scope, no build step.** `index.html` loads every script
  with a plain `<script src>` tag and every button is an inline `onclick` resolved on
  the global scope. Turning any of them into `type="module"` breaks every button
  silently — no error, the taps just stop working. The one exception is
  `js/sync/firebase-adapter.js` (the SDK ships only as modules); it is imported at
  runtime by `app.js` AFTER local boot and reaches the app through `window.FarkadSync`.
- **Script order is load-bearing.** `store.js` and `recovery.js` must precede
  `sync/sync.js`, which reads its outbox the moment it loads; `model/schema.js` must
  precede `state.js`, which calls `emptySchedule()` at definition time; the UI files
  come after the data layer. The order in `index.html` is the order.
- **Nothing off this origin sits between a person and their data.** The Firebase SDK is
  fetched after boot, never before the first render, and fails soft. SheetJS is not
  fetched at all any more: `vendor/xlsx-0.18.5.min.js` is in the service worker's shell,
  so the export works in a tunnel. Reaching the CSV fallback now means the build on that
  phone is incomplete, not that the signal is weak, and it says so.
- **The service worker (`sw.js`) serves everything cache-first**, the page included:
  a session runs one build, end to end. Data lives in `localStorage`, always through
  `Store`; sync is optional and off until `js/sync/firebase-config.js` is filled in.

## The iron laws

1. **The ledger is append-only and its writer gate stays closed.** `LEDGER_WRITES` in
   `js/model/ledger.js` is `false` and only a person who knows all three phones are
   past v79 may flip it. The boot-time mirror in `state.js` is the ONE sanctioned
   write; ledger entries are never edited, never deleted, and merged by union.
2. **Days keep the rate they were worked at.** Rates are stamped onto the day record
   at first write and survive every later edit; reports price each day at its stamp.
   Never restate a stamped day, and never stamp old days retroactively —
   `planRateStamping` reports what that would do and deliberately does not do it.
3. **Never claim saved before a durable commit.** Every edit goes journal-first, then
   schedule, both written through `Store.setVerified` (write, read back, believe).
   A commit with nowhere durable to live rolls memory back and says so out loud.
4. **No ordinary edit sends the whole document.** One field path per edit
   (`days.<date>.<layer>.<worker>`); the server document is adopted, never
   timestamp-compared; whole-document writes exist only for the explicit restore
   transaction. Bulk edits go through `State.commitMany`, never a bare `save()`.
5. **The three build stamps move together**, in the same commit as any change to a
   cached file: the `farkad-build` meta in `index.html`, `APP_VERSION` in `js/app.js`,
   and `VERSION` in `sw.js`. `tests/build.test.mjs` fails if they disagree.
6. **Hebrew strings are product decisions, not copy.** Many are pinned verbatim by
   tests; all of them were argued over. Changing one is a behavior change and the
   pinned string moves with it, deliberately, in the same commit.
7. **A session runs one build, end to end — and so does every OTHER window.**
   `clients.claim()` takes over every window of the origin, so `sw.js` serves a window
   it did not itself hand a page to from THAT window's build, keeps that build's cache
   while it is open, and the page reloads itself at the first moment nobody is typing.
   A build already on somebody's phone cannot be given new code, so the catch-up half
   only holds from v87 forward; `tests/handover.test.mjs` measures the rest against two
   real trees.
8. **Safe-area via `env()`, never a hardcoded inset** — and the bar heights are
   MEASURED (`js/ui/bars.js`) and published as custom properties, never written into
   the stylesheet as numbers.
9. **44px touch targets and 16px inputs are floors, not tastes.** Below 16px iOS zooms
   the page on focus; below 44px in EITHER dimension a finger misses. The mobile suite
   measures both.
10. **Nothing unreadable is ever deleted, overwritten, or treated as empty.**
    `Recovery` quarantines a copy, keeps the original, and blocks writes until the
    person is told. A record that will not parse is still the only record of work.
11. **No `prompt`/`confirm`/`alert`, ever** — they are silently ignored in embedded
    frames. Use `askText`/`askConfirm`/`askTell` from `js/ui/ask.js`.

## Running it, and what green means

No build, no install: `python3 -m http.server` serves the app. For the tests:

    npm ci
    npm test                # the sixteen node suites; no browser, runs in a minute
    npm run test:all        # adds smoke, print, mobile, update, recovery-browser, handover
    npm run test:rules      # firestore.rules against the local emulator (needs Java)

Node 20 or 22 (`engines` says `>=20.11 <23`). At this commit `npm test` is **3104/3104**
across 28 suites, and `npm run test:release` — which adds the browser suites and
`sendclaim` — is the gate a build has to pass whole. Anything less than every check
passing is a stop, not a warning. `npm test` and `npm run test:release` are different
gates and are reported separately; neither is wrapped in anything that turns a nonzero
exit into a success. The browser suites need Playwright's Chromium once
(`npm run browsers`), or point `CHROME_PATH` at a browser that is already installed —
see `tests/README.md` before downloading anything.

## The culture

A behavior with a passing test IS the spec. The suites pin exact strings, exact
arithmetic, and exact rectangles; when your change makes a test fail, the first
question is whether the test is describing a guarantee you are about to break. Update
a pinned expectation only when the behavior change is the point, in the same commit,
with the reason in the message. New invariants ship with the test that would have
caught their absence — most of `tests/data.test.mjs` is a bug that happened once,
written down so it cannot happen twice.
